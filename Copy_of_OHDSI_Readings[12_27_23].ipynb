For example: \"Should you bias towards detectng all possible individuals with a particular condition, thus maximizing sample size and statistical power, or should you aim to minimize the false positive rate at the expense of missing people?\" -- The answer depends to some extent on the size of the dataset. In the enclave, even a very restrictive definition could yield a sample of 10's of thousands of people. An absolute sample size of that many people might be sufficient to characterize the condition. In this way, the size of the N3Cs database may facillitate higher quality results, by allowing users to screen out false positives. But... it may also allow users to select highly unrepresentative samples, that don't generalize well.\n",
